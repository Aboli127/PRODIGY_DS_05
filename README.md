    "📊 Task: Traffic Accident Analysis & Visualization\n",
    "🎯 Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to **road conditions, weather, and time of day**, and to visualize **accident hotspots and contributing factors**. The goal is to uncover insights that can help in road safety planning and accident prevention.\n",
    "\n",
    "🏞️ Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "    Dataset Used: US Accidents Dataset (March 2023)\n",
    "    File: US_Accidents_March23.csv\n",
    "    Description: The dataset contains information about traffic accidents in the US, including accident severity, time, location, weather conditions, visibility, and precipitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "🛠️ Tools & Technologies\n",
    "\n",
    "    Python\n",
    "    Pandas & NumPy\n",
    "    Matplotlib & Seaborn\n",
    "    Folium / Geopandas (for geographic visualization)\n",
    "\n",
    "🧹 Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "The following preprocessing steps were performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Checked and cleaned missing values\n",
    "    Converted date/time columns into appropriate formats\n",
    "    Prepared numerical and categorical features for analysis\n",
    "    Extracted hour and day of week from timestamp for time-based analysis\n",
    "    Selected relevant columns for visualization and analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "📊 Data Analysis & Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "The project includes the following analysis and visualizations:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Distribution of Traffic Accidents by Hour\n",
    "    Distribution of Accidents by Day of Week\n",
    "    Top Weather Conditions During Accidents\n",
    "    Visibility Distribution During Accidents\n",
    "    Accident Severity Distribution\n",
    "    Accident Hotspots (Geographical)\n",
    "\n",
    "(Optional enhancements: Severity vs Weather, Severity vs Visibility, Severity vs Precipitation)\n",
    "\n",
    "🔍 Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "    Accidents occur more frequently during **rush hours**.\n",
    "    Weather conditions such as **rain, fog, and low visibility** significantly impact accident occurrence.\n",
    "    Accident severity peaks under **poor visibility and extreme weather conditions**.\n",
    "    Geographical hotspots highlight locations with higher accident frequency, which can inform traffic safety measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Conclusion 🏁\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates the application of **data analysis and visualization** techniques to real-world traffic accident data. It identifies patterns in time, weather, and location, providing actionable insights for improving road safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "📂 Dataset Note\n",
    "\n",
    "The original dataset (US_Accidents_March23.csv) is approximately 2.8 GB and cannot be uploaded to GitHub due to size limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For demonstration and analysis purposes, a random sample of 50,000 records\n",
    "(US_Accidents_sample.csv) has been used in this repository.\n",
