# 📊 Task-05: Traffic Accident Analysis & Visualization

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to **road conditions, weather, and time of day**, and to visualize **accident hotspots and contributing factors**.  
The goal is to derive actionable insights that can help improve **road safety and accident prevention**.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Dataset Name:** US Accidents Dataset (March 2023)
- **Source:** Kaggle – US Accidents Dataset
- **Original File:** US_Accidents_March23.csv
- **Sample File Used in This Project:** US_Accidents_sample.csv

---

## 🚫 Why the Full CSV File Is NOT Uploaded to GitHub
The original dataset file **US_Accidents_March23.csv** is approximately **2.8 GB** in size.

GitHub does **not allow files larger than 100 MB** to be uploaded in a repository.  
Therefore, the full dataset **cannot be included** in this GitHub project.

👉 To solve this, a **random sample of 50,000 records**
(`US_Accidents_sample.csv`) has been created and used for **all analysis and visualizations** in this repository.

📥 Anyone who wants to work with the **complete dataset** can download it directly from the official source:

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing
The following preprocessing steps were performed:
- Checked and handled missing values
- Converted date-time columns into appropriate formats
- Extracted **Hour** and **Day of Week** from timestamps
- Selected relevant columns for analysis
- Prepared data for visualization

---

## 📈 Data Analysis & Visualizations
The project includes the following analyses and visualizations:

- Distribution of Traffic Accidents by Hour  
- Distribution of Accidents by Day of Week  
- Top Weather Conditions During Accidents  
- Visibility Distribution During Accidents  
- Accident Severity Distribution  
- Accident Hotspots (Geographical Analysis)

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Accidents occur more frequently during **rush hours**
- **Poor visibility** and adverse weather conditions significantly increase accident risk
- Accident severity increases under **extreme weather conditions**
- Certain geographical locations show higher accident concentration

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of **data analysis and visualization techniques** on real-world traffic accident data.  
The insights derived can support **traffic safety planning and accident prevention strategies**.
